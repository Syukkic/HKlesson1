*Hong Kong Lesson One*, this series of articles are written by [Leung Kai Chi (梁啟智)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hant/%E6%A2%81%E5%95%9F%E6%99%BA) and posted on [matters.news](https://matters.news/@leungkaichihk/%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E8%AA%B2-%E7%B0%A1%E4%BB%8B%E5%8F%8A%E7%9B%AE%E9%8C%84-zdpuB2J818r8yUSDeZ4vDARrnQ4ut3S2UYjALXHJ16jp25w4P) for free.

China government has blocked matters.news. So, it's a little difficult for people to visit [matters.news](https://matters.news/) in mainland of China. I want to share this series to people knowing nothing about Hong Kong, to people misunderstanding Hong Kong and to more people daring to know the truth.

So, I make a PDF version.
